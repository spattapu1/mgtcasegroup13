            <h2>Write-Up</h2>
            <p>Tesla is an automotive and technology giant, with a heavily debated stock valuation. Through some financial analysis, we can attempt to derive a reasonable stock valuation for the company. We conducted a series of analysis, a base discounted cash flow analysis, a sensitivity analysis, as well as a multiple analysis. After going through these analyses, we will decide a reasonable valuation for Teslaâ€™s stock.</p>
            <p>For the DCF analysis, we used the base case revenue growth percentages. We also discounted the revenues per year by the Cost of Revenue, R&D, and SG&A, in the EBITDA calculations, which lead to our final free cash flow. Through the base DCF, we arrived at a valuation of $33.18 per share. </p>
            <p>Discounted cash flows analysis is assumption heavy since we are estimating the valuation of Tesla based on assumptions we are making about their future free cash flows based on assumptions about revenue growth, cost of revenue, R&D, SG&A, depreciation, capital expenditures, etc. But DCF does provide us with a valuation that is based on the potential future free cash flows of the company unlike multiples. As a result though, if  the assumptions we make about the future of the company are more conservative or very liberal, we can see a lot of fluctuations in Tesla's valuation, which we will see in our sensitivity analysis. </p>
            <p>First, we explored the sensitivity of the revenue growth assumptions by looking at the Upside and Downside revenue growth assumptions, which would help us generate a range for the base case valuation we did previously. Through which we arrived at a valuation of $35.37 for the upside which is an increase of $2.19 from the base case and 31.78 for the downside which is a decrease of $1.18. This gives us a range of $3.60. The movement of the valuation makes inherent sense when since revenue moved parallelly to changes in revenue. </p>
            <p>We then looked at the sensitivity of the cost of revenue assumptions by using a higher cost of revenue that increases and levels at 85% from 2029 onwards. This drastically lowers the base case share price from 33.18 to 16.81 which is a decrease of $16.37. This gross margin is closer to the margins of automotive competitors. When we look at the stock valuations of automotive firms we see a similar valuation around $3-$20, so adjusting to their gross margins gives Tesla a similar valuation. But this neglects the fact that Tesla is also a technology company meaning a lot of their car parts are manufactured by the company itself, likely cutting costs for the company making their gross margins higher. But through this analysis we can see that changes in cost of revenue impact stock valuation very steeply. </p>
