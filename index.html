            <p>Through multiple financial analyses, we can ascertain a range of reasonable valuations for Tesla's stock. This first analysis we did was a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. 
                Through this analysis we arrived at a valuation of $33.18 per share which feels incredibly conservative. When conducting an analysis using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, 
                we are bound by the inputs and assumptions we make about the projected growth or decline of the company's revenue, depreciation, cost of revenue, capital expediture, research and development 
                and selling and general administrative expenses in this case. We may not even be including entirely different expeditures or 
                savings that could be made in the future years. Therefore its diffcult to say that the price per share value of $33.18 is an accurate stock valuation.</p>

            <p> But we can mitigate some of this uncertainty by conducting a sensitvity analysis, by using a range of possible revenue growth rates to determine a more accurate valuation range. This way we can continue to make predictions about Tesla's revenue using the DCF approach but account for the uncertainty of the assumptions in the previous approach.</p>
